# MUSIC-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES

<H3>The objective of this project is to do a comparative study to detect and classify music files automatically based on 
its genre by using various classification algorithms. Music genre classification is a popular problem in the 
domain of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) used in many music streaming platforms such as Pandora which 
is an automated music recommendation service based on the Music Genome Project, that suggests songs to 
users based on similarity of songs that the user is interested in. In this project we have done a comparative study 
using various machine learning classification algorithms to classify music files based on its genre.</H3>

<H3>As per the accuracy results, we find that XGBooster has the highest accuracy of 90%, and then Random 
Forests and KNN have an accuracy of 81% and 80% respectively. We build our final model using the 
XGBooster algorithm and perform feature importance.We find perceptr_var, perceptr_mean and 
mfcc4_mean to be features that have the highest weights of importance. Finally, using the cosine_similarity 
library we find the best similar matches to the given input audio.</H3>
